Fonts for Asteroids Game

Place the following font file in this directory:

1. arial.ttf - Default font for UI elements

You can use any TTF font that works well for game UI. Arial is commonly available on most systems, but you can substitute it with any clear, readable font.

Note: The game will attempt to use arial.ttf by default. If you use a different font, update the font name in ResourceManager.cpp.
