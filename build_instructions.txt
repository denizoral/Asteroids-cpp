Asteroids Game - Build Instructions
======================================

I've created a convenient build script to make compiling and running the game easier.

First, make the script executable:

    chmod +x build.sh

Basic usage examples:

1. Clean, build with SFML, and run:
    ./build.sh -c -r

2. Build without SFML (text-only mode):
    ./build.sh -n

3. Enable verbose output to see all compiler messages:
    ./build.sh -v

4. Get help on all available options:
    ./build.sh -h

If you encounter SFML-related errors, you may need to:
1. Install SFML: brew install sfml
2. Update SFML: brew upgrade sfml
3. Or try building without SFML: ./build.sh -n

For complete details, see the README_BUILD.md file.

For macOS Sequoia 15.0 compatibility, the build system has been configured 
to create a proper app bundle with appropriate settings.

Enjoy the game!
